We'll be using the command-line for most of these.\n\nIf you are on Linux/Mac, you'll be working with the terminal. \nIf you are on Windows, I recommend you install [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install), and specifically the Ubuntu distribution. That will give you a command-line shell that you can use to interact with the remote server.\n\nOn your machine, I recommend using a text editor to edit the scripts in your terminal. Good ones include [Visual Studio Code (VS Code) ](https://code.visualstudio.com/), or built in ones such as `nano`. You can use VSCode to edit scripts remotely using the SSH extension. Editing scripts remotely like this may be more comfortable for you.\n\n## Where Am I?\n\nOne of the confusing things about working on HPC is that sometimes you have a shell open on the head node, but oftentimes, you are on a worker node. \n\nYour totem for telling which node you're in is `hostname`, which will give you the host name of the machine you're on.\n\nFor example, if I used `grabnode` to grab a `gizmo` node for interactive work, I can check which node I'm in by using:\n\n```bash\nhostname\n```\n\n```\ngizmok164\n```\nIf you're confused about which node you're in, remember `hostname`\n\n## Navigating the Unix/Linux filesystem\n\nWe'll start out our Unix/Linux journey talking about the filesystem, which has some quirks we need to be aware of.\n\n### Going `/home`: `~/`\n\nThere is one important shortcut you should always remember: `~/` is shorthand for your own home directory.\n\nDepending on the linux distribution, this can be a different location. On the FH filesystem, when I use `~/`, it maps to:\n\n`/home/tladera2`\n\nThe home directory is also important because it is where your configuration files live, such as `.bashrc` (see below).\n\n### Absolute versus relative paths\n\nAbsolute paths contain all the information needed to find a file in a file system from the root `/` directory. For example, this would be an absolute path:\n\n```\n/fh/fast/laderas_t/immuno_project/raw_data/tcr_data.fasta\n```\n\nAbsolute paths always start with `/`, because that is the root directory.\n\nRelative paths break up an absolute path into two pieces of information: 1) your current directory and 2) the path *relative* to that directory. Relative paths are really helpful because things don't break when you move your folder or files. \n\nIf my current path the directory `/fh/fast/laderas_t/immuno_project/`, then the relative path to that same file would be:\n\n```\nraw_data/tcr_data.fasta\n```\n\nNote that this relative path does not start with a `/`, because our current directory isn't the root directory. \n\nYou may have seen relative paths such as `../another_directory/` - these mean to go up a directory in the file hierarchy, and then look in that directory for the `another_directory/` directory. I try to avoid using relative paths like these.\n\nIn general for portability and reproducibility, you will want to use relative paths **within a directory**, and avoid using relative paths like `../../my_folder`, where you are navigating up. In general, use relative paths to navigate down. \n\n### Keep Everything in a Folder\n\nWe need to talk about code and data organization. For the FH system, we have a `/home/` directory, and if we have generated research data, a `/fh/fast/` directory.\n\nIdeally, we want to make the naming conventions of our code and our data as similar as possible.\n\nThe requirements of bioinformatics analysis usually require a huge amount of data. \n\n### Moving Things Around\n\nA lot of the time, we need to move files between shared filesystems. One filesystem might be good at storage and be backed up on a regular basis, while another filesystem might be better for temporary work on the cluster. \n\nYou're probably familiar with `mv`, which lets you move files around in Unix. One thing to keep in mind when you're `mv`ing things to a new folder that there is a difference between:\n\n```bash\nmv log.txt my_folder   ## renames log.txt to my_folder\n```\n\nand\n\n```bash\nmv log.txt my_folder/  ## moves log.txt to be in my_folder\n```\nThis is one thing that trips me up all the time. \n\nThis is one situation where using a GUI such as Motuz can be very helpful. \n\n### Things I always forget: the difference between `/home/mydir/`  and `home/mydir/`\n\nSome things that trip me up all the time. The difference between \n\n```bash\n/home/mydir/    #absolute path\n```\nand \n\n```bash\nhome/mydir/`    #relative path\n```\nThe first one is an *absolute path*, and the second is a *relative path*. If you're getting `file not found` messages, check to make sure the path is the right format.\n\n## Environment Variables\n\nEnvironment variables are variables which can be seen globally in the Linux system across executables. \n\nYou can get a list of all set environment variables by using the `env` command. Here's an example from my own system:\n\n```bash\nenv\n```\n```\nSHELL=/bin/bash\nNVM_INC=/home/tladera2/.nvm/versions/node/v21.7.1/include/node\nWSL_DISTRO_NAME=Ubuntu\nNAME=2QM6TV3\nPWD=/home/tladera2\nLOGNAME=tladera2\n[....]\n```\n\nOne common environment variable you may have seen is `$JAVA_HOME`, which is used to find the Java Software Development Kit (SDK). (I usually encounter it when a software application yells at me when I haven't set it.)\n\nYou can see whether an environment variable is set using `echo`, such as \n\n```bash\necho $PATH\n```\n\n```\n/home/tladera2/.local/bin:/home/tladera2/gems/bin:/home/tladera2/.nvm/versions/node/v21.7.1/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/ [....]\n```\n\n### Setting Environment Variables\n\nIn Bash, we use the `export` command to declare an environment variable. For example, if we wanted to declare the environment variable `$SAMTOOLS_PATH` we'd do the following:\n\n```bash\nexport SAMTOOLS_PATH=\"/home/tladera2/miniconda/bin/\"\n```\n\nOne thing to note is that spacing matters when you declare environment variables. For example, this won't declare the `$SAMTOOLS_PATH` variable:\n\n```bash\nexport SAMTOOLS_PATH = \"/home/tladera2/miniconda/bin/\"\n```\n\nAnother thing to note is that we declare environment variables differently than we use then. If we wanted to use `$SAMTOOLS_PATH` we'd use a dollar sign (`$`) in front of it:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash/\n$SAMTOOLS_PATH/samtools view -c $input_file\n```\nIn this case, the value of `$SAMTOOLS_PATH` will be expanded (substituted) to give:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash/\n/home/tladera2/miniconda/bin/samtools view -c $input_file\n```\n\n### A Very Special Environment Variable: `$PATH`\n\nThe most important environment variable is the `$PATH` variable. This variable is important because it determines where to search for software executables. \n\nWe add to the `$PATH` by appending to it. You might have seen the following bit of code in your `.bashrc`:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=$PATH:/home/tladera2/samtools/\n```\n\nWe are adding the path `/home/tladera2/samtools/` to our `$PATH` environment variable. Note that how we refer to the `PATH` variable is different depending on which side the variable is on of the equals sign. \n\nWe declare the variable using `export PATH` and we append to the variable using `$PATH`. This is something that trips me up all the time. \n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## For FH Users\n\nIn general, when you use environment modules on `gizmo`, you do not need to modify your `$PATH` variable. You mostly need to modify it when you are compiling executables so that the system can find them. Be sure to use `which` to see where the environment module is actually located:\n\n`which samtools`\n:::\n\n### `.bashrc` versus `.bash_profile`\n\nOk, what's the difference between `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`?\n\nThe main difference is when these two files are sourced. `bash_profile` is used when you do an interactive login, and `.bashrc` is used for non-interactive shells.\n\n`.bashrc` should contain the environment variables that you use all the time, such as `$PATH` and `$JAVA_HOME` for example. You can get the best of both worlds by including the following line in your `.bash_profile`:\n\n```bash\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n## Working with Shell Scripts\n\n> Note that I'm only covering bash scripting (hence the name of the book). Each shell has different conventions.\n\nWhen you are writing shell scripts, there's a few things to know to make them executable. \n\n### The she-bang: `#!`\n\nIf you've looked at a shell script and seen the following:\n\n```bash\n#| filename: samcount.sh\n#!/bin/bash\nsamtools view -c $1 > $1.counts.txt\n```\n\nthe `#!` is known as a she-bang - it's a signal to Linux what shell interpreter to use when running the script on the command line.\n\n### Making things executable: `chmod`\n\nNow we have our shell script, we will need to make it executable. We can do this using `chmod`\n\n```bash\nchmod +x samcount.sh\n```\n\nNow we can run it using:\n\n```bash\n./samcount.sh bam_file.bam\n```\n\nBecause the script is not on our `$PATH`, then we need to specify the location of the script using `./`. \n\nNote that you can always execute scripts using the `bash` command, even if they're not made executable on your filesystem\n\n```bash\nbash samcount.sh bam_file.bam\n```\n\n## Useful Utilities\n\nThe following section outlines some useful unix utilities that can be very helpful when you're working in bash. Most of these should be available in HPC systems by default.\n\n### Text editors: `vim` or `nano`\n\nIn general, we recommend connecting an editor such as VS Code via SSH to make it easier to edit files. But sometimes you just need to edit a file on the system directly.\n\nThat's what `nano` and `vim` are for. Of these, `nano` has the smallest learning curve, since it works like most editors. `vim` is powerful, but there is a steep learning curve associated with it. \n\n### `screen` or `tmux`: keep your session open\n\n\n{{< video https://youtu.be/fYWszwc-LXM >}}\n\n\n\nOftentimes, when you are running something interactive on a system, you'll have to leave your shell open. Otherwise, your running job will terminate.\n\nYou can use `screen` or `tmux`, which are known as window managers, to keep your sessions open on a remote machine. We'll talk about `screen`.\n\n![](images/start_screen.png)\n\n`screen` works by starting a new bash shell. You can tell this because your bash prompt will change.\n\nThe key of working remotely with `screen` is that you can then request an `hpc` node. \n\nFor FH users, you can request a `gizmo` node using `grabnode`. We can then check we're on the `gizmo` node by using `hostname`.\n\nIf we have something running on this node, we can keep it running by *detaching* the screen session. Once we are detached, we should check that we're back in `rhino` by using `hostname`. Now we can log out and our job will keep running.\n\n![](images/reattach_screen.png)\n\nIf we need to get back into that `screen` session, we can use \n\n```bash\nscreen ls\n```\nTo list the number of sessions. Once we've\n\n### The `Tab` key\n\nNever underestimate the usefulness of the tab key, which triggers autocompletion on the command line. It can help you complete paths to files, \n\n### `squeue -u <username>`\n\nSometimes you will want to know where you are in the queue of all the other jobs that are in the run queue in SLURM. You can use `squeue` with `-u` (username) option to look for your username. For example:\n\n\n```{bash}\n#| eval: false\nsqueue -u tladera2\n```\n\n",
