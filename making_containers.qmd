# Making Your Own Containers

## Making Dockerfiles

One way to build Docker Images is to use a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a recipe for installing software and its dependencies.

Let's take a look at a Dockerfile. By default, it is contained within a folder and is called `Dockerfile`:

```
FROM ubuntu:18.04

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y build-essential  && \
    apt-get install -y wget && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

ENV CONDA_DIR /opt/conda
RUN wget --quiet https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh -O ~/miniconda.sh && \
     /bin/bash ~/miniconda.sh -b -p /opt/conda

ENV PATH=$CONDA_DIR/bin:$PATH

#install plink with conda
RUN conda install -c "bioconda/label/cf201901" plink
RUN conda install -c "bioconda/label/cf201901" samtools
```

We can build the Docker image in our directory using:

```
docker build . -t gatk_sam_plink:0.0.1
```

When it's done, we can then make sure it's been built by using

```
docker images
```

And we can use it like any other image.
